# GDCI: Robust empirical Bayes confidence intervals using gamma-divergence

This repository provides R code implementing robust empirical Bayes confidence intervals using gamma-divergence, as proposed by the following paper.

Kurisu, D., Ishihara, T. and Sugasawa, S. (2021). Adaptively Robust small area estimation: balancing robustness and efficiency of empirical Bayes confidence intervals. [arXiv:2108.11551](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11551)

The repository includes the following files.

* `GDCI-function.R` : Script implementing the proposed method
* `simulation.R` : Script of one-shot simulation 
* `crimedata.RData` : Summary statistics of crimedata used in our analysis 
* `data-analysis.R` : Script of an application to the crime data

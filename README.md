# GDCI: Robust empirical Bayes confidence intervals using gamma-divergence

This repository provides R code implementing robust empirical Bayes confidence intervals using gamma-divergence, as proposed by the following paper.

Kurisu, D., Ishihara, T. and Sugasawa, S. (2021). Robust and Efficient Empirical Bayes Confidence Intervals using \gamma-Divergence. (available at arXiv)

The repository includes the following files.

* `GDCI-function.R` : Script implementing the proposed method
* `simulation.R` : Script applying the proposed method to two simulated datasets 
* `crimedata.RData`: Summary statistics of crimedata used in our analysis 
* `data-analysis`.R: Script for analyzing the crime data
